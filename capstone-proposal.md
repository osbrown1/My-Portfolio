Name of Project: Portfolio with First Person Shooter

Project's Purpose or Goal: It will allow the user to browse a polished portfolio and access many applications, including a First Person Shooter game I spent time making along with my portfolio. Hopefully the Portfolio looks nice and the game is fun. 

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
•	Portfolio has no bugs, lists and provides access to my projects
•	Game is in the first person, has basic FPS functionality you’d expect
•	Game has AI that can take damage and damage you

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
•	Portfolio: Next Js, Tailwind CSS, Framer-motion, Javascript, React
•	Game: Unreal Engine 5, Animation Blueprint, Widget Blueprint, Landscape and Foliage, Nav Mesh Bounds Volume for AI, Character Blueprint

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
•	Game: Ammo pickup, Health pickup, Enemy waves spawning per round
•	Portfolio: Get the UE5 game readily playable in the portfolio

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
•	Game: Overlap Events
•	Portfolio: File size manipulation, packaging and exporting it inside the engine

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
•	Working on a way to commit and push my unreal game with .gitignore in order to deal with the file size.
